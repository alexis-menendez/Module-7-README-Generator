##  README Generator
**Description**

The README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a high-quality, professional `README.md` file based on user input. By streamlining the README creation process, this tool enables developers to focus on building their projects rather than formatting documentation. 

### Features:

* Prompts users for project details such as title, description, installation, usage, license, and contributors.
* Dynamically generates a well-structured README file.
* Supports multiple license options with an automatically generated badge and relevant license section.
* Provides a table of contents with clickable links for easy navigation.
