# **Professional README Generator**

## **Description**

This command-line application generates a professional `README.md` file based on user input. By using the **Inquirer** package, developers can quickly create high-quality documentation for their projects without manually formatting a README.

### **Motivation & Purpose**
- Developers often need a structured and professional README for their projects but may not want to spend extra time formatting it.
- This project streamlines the process, allowing users to generate a fully formatted README by answering a few prompts.

### **Problem Solved**
- Ensures consistency and professionalism in README files.
- Saves time by automating the formatting and structure of documentation.
- Encourages better project documentation and collaboration.

### **What I Learned**
- How to use **Node.js** and the **Inquirer** package to handle user input.
- How to dynamically generate Markdown files from JavaScript.
- The importance of clear and well-structured project documentation.
